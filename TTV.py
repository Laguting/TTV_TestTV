# objects from Class TV and will produce the following output:
# tv1's channel is 30 and volume level is 3
# tv2's channel is 3 and volume level is 2

# Turn om the  TV

    # Power on
    # Power off
    # Return the channel
    # Set a new channel
    # Return volume
    # Set a new volume
    # Change Channels
    # Channel increases by 1
    # Channel decreases by 1
    # Change Volume
    # Volume increases by 1
    # Volume decreases by 1
    # Assign TV 1 and TV 2' attributes (channel and volume)
    # Display the results

    # Close the TV
